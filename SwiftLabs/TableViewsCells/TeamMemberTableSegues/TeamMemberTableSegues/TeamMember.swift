//    TeamMember is a model class that represents each member of your team. It should have a name (name), phone number (phoneNumber), birth city (birthCity), birth state (birthState), favorite band (favoriteBand), and photo (photo). (Hint: use UIImage for the photo property. You can use the class method imageNamed: to retrieve assets in your assets catalog. We've included some images with this project Notice the blue folder Images.xcassets in your file navigator? That's where you can find the images.)
