//TeamDetailViewController is pushed onto the navigation stack when a button is pressed in TeamViewController. It displays the details for the particular team member that was tapped in the TeamViewController. TeamDetailViewController should have a public property of type TeamMember called teamMember.

import UIKit

class TeamDetailViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {
        super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()
        // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.
    }
    

    /*
    // MARK: - Navigation

    // In a storyboard-based application, you will often want to do a little preparation before navigation
    override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
        // Get the new view controller using segue.destinationViewController.
        // Pass the selected object to the new view controller.
    }
